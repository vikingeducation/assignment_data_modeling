4. You want to build an e-commerce site like a very simplified Amazon.com. You'll need to keep track of products, users, orders, shipments and all the bits and pieces necessary to glue them all together. Design the data model for this web app.

users - can have multiple orders
  - User table: id:int, first_name:string, last_name:string, emails: string
  - Join table for address and users - many (users) to many (address)
  - Address table: id:int, street:string, city: string, state: string, zip: int
  - Billing table: id:int, user_id:int, street:string, city: string, state: string, zip: int, cc_type:string, cc_number:int, cc_exp:date

products - can belong to multiple orders (one product can be in multiple orders)
	- Product table: id:int, name:string, description:string, price:int, order_id:int, weight:int

orders  - can have multiple products (one order has many products) and belongs to one user (one user has many orders)
	- Order table: id:int, user_id:int, billing_price:int

shipments - belongs to an order (one-to-one)
	- Shipment table: id:int, order_id:int, shipping_label:int, ShipPrice_id:int
	- ShipPrice table: id:int, weight:int, price:int

5. You want to collect analytics data for visitors and logged-in-users who are visiting your website. This includes basic information like page views and more advanced things like link clicks and time on page. You ideally want to tie this information back to a given user if possible. Design the data model for this analytics infrastructure.
