  - Billing table: id:int, user_id:int, street:string, city: string, state: string, zip: int, cc_type:string, cc_number:int, cc_exp:date

products - can belong to multiple orders (one product can be in multiple orders)
	- Product table: id:int, name:string, description:string, price:int, order_id:int, weight:int
