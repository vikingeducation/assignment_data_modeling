For each of the following scenarios, think through
- the product which is being created
- and then write down the models, columns, validations and associations you might use to implement it like we did in the example above.

You want to build a message board like Hacker News. Users can post links. Other users can comment on these submissions or comment on the comments. How would you make sure a comment knows where in the hierarchy it lives? Design the data model for this web app.

1. The product which is being created.
The product is a message board where users can post links and other users can comment on these submissions or comment on the comments.

Users - Posts - Comments

A user can have many posts

A comment can have many comments
A comment can only belong to one comment 


User
user_id - user_details
      \
Post
post_id - user_id - post_details
        \
Comment
comment_id - post_id - comment_details
          \
Reply
reply_id - comment_id - chat_details

2. How would you make sure a comment know where in the hierarchy it lives?

If it's a comment of the post, we can just pull up all the comments that have that post_id and then order them by comment_id

If it's a reply of a comment, we can just pull up all the replies that belong to a comment_id and then order them by reply_id.
