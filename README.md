StudentCourse (join)

The idea of Course-Lessons as 1-many is that even if the lessons are repeated over courses, the responsibility changes.  Ie, that the responsibility for the lesson in a course is governed by the course even if the material behind it is the same.  There could be other entities which are hypothetically responsible for assigning or maintaining a single lesson across multiple courses but in the prompt we don't know who those entities are.


USER PROFILES

User
    name
    age
    gender
    city
    state
    country    

Profile
    username

Email
    address
    user-key
    profile-key

My first idea is that the Profile represents info that the user presents to others on the site, whereas the User represents the User's actual identity.  I'm not sure about having the email as the link between the User and the Profile.  The upshot of that, it seems, is that the User has the choice of maintaining that link or severing it.  If, as it some case, the site proprietor has a strong interest in "locking" user identity, there could be tighter coupling between them.

All comments have an associated article so the article-key field cannot be null.  We can search on all the comments of a user (or some subset) by searching the author field of the comments.
